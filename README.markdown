# Ruby on Rails : my first Social Network site

This going-to-be site devoted to the movie advising; I want to create a service where people can help each other to decide where to go to see a good movie tonight.
Main concept is to do it quickly and reliable. Advising engine will base its decisions using "likes" of other people in your "group".
